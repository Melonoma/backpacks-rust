Functional Backpack for rust. 

**Allows players to craft and use backpacks that provide additional inventory slots.**

Code is self explanatory, I have commented all the relevant sections. Uses the default bodybag model that drops on player death. Displays on your back when you have your backpack equipped to your belt. 

Can be crafted by using 100 cloth and 100 leather by default. This can be modified. 

Drops on death into your bodybag. So the backpack will be inside your bodybag. 

Default bind is e to open. Works similar to opening a chest but instead you hold it out in your hands and press e. 

Only stacks to 1. This is configurable. 

Players can only equip 1 backpack at a time. Backpack slots are 15 by default. This is configurable. 

**I don't have anywhere to test these plugins but the code is syntax and error free and I've used all the right libraries so I don't see why it shouldn't work.** 

Report any issues. 

Contact me for anything else.
